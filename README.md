# App_Store_Analysis

### Situation

The goal of the project was to bring data-driven insights to decide what type of app to build on the app store for the aspiring app developer.

### Task

 My role in the project was to analyze the App Store data and perform the data analysis in SQL and bring out meaningful recommendations for the stakeholder.

### Action

- To work with the project I had been provided with 2 csv files. The first one was applestore.csv which provided information for apps like app names, ratings, sizing bytes, supporting devices, and supporting languages.
- The second dataset was appleStore_description.csv which gives an overview of each application description.
- I conducted an exploratory data analysis first to see whether there are any missing values or if the data is complete and if there are any impurities in the data.
- After that, I conducted data analysis on the data to find if paid apps have higher ratings than free apps, also checked whether apps with more supported languages have higher ratings, and if there is a correlation between the length of the app description and the user rating and which app is top-rated for each genre.

### Result

These are the final recommendations that I would suggest to the aspiring app developer:

1) **Paid Apps have better ratings** [ This could be because of a number of reasons, one being that users who pay for an app may have higher engagement and perceived more value which might have led to better ratings for the paid apps.]

2) **Apps supporting between 10 and 30 Languages have better ratings.** [ So it is not necessary to work on many languages and we can focus on other aspects of the app. ]

3) **Finance and Book Apps have low ratings.** [ From this we can see that user needs are not met in finance and books apps, so this can be a market opportunity to build an app in one of these categories. ]

 4) **Apps with longer descriptions have better ratings.** [ Users likely appreciate having a clear understanding of the app's features and capabilities before they download, leading to better ratings. ]

 5) **A new App should aim for an average rating above 3.5.** [ In app store average rating of all the apps is around 3.5, so for the new app to stand out the rating of the new app should be more than 3.5. ]

 6) **Games and Entertainment genres have high competition.** [ These categories have a very high volume of apps, so entering these spaces might be a little challenging because of high competition, but also suggests a high user demand in these sectors. ]
